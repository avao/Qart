# Overview

Qart.Wheels is the test project to exercise Qart's functionality. Its
vision is to become a Web-based UI for Qart. For now its simply a set
of end points that return information about a Qart project.

Actions we may want to be able to do to a Qart project:

- Given a top-level directory, return me all test cases with their
  descriptions.
- Execute a top-level directory and return the results of the
  execution.
